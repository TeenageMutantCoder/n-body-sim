# Solar System

This is a simulation made in React JS that shows how planets move in a solar system. I made this for the final project of my Physics class, since I was allowed to choose my topic and project media.

Goals (not necessarily in a particular order):

- [ ] Create solar system with planets and a star
- [ ] Make the planets revolve around the star
- [ ] Make the solar system a model of our solar system
- [ ] Create a menu or UI to allow user to edit solar system (move or add objects)
- [x] Make a camera that allows user to move around and zoom in/out
- [ ] Make a page that explains the math used
- [ ] Make it 3D (maybe allow switching between 2D and 3D)
