# Orbital Sim

This is an N-body simulation made in React JS that shows how planets (or other celestial bodies) orbit other celestial bodies. I made this for the final project of my Physics class because I was allowed to choose my topic and project media. The website contains a landing page, a simulation, and a page that explains the math used for the simulation.

Goals (not necessarily in a particular order):

- [x] Add circles or spheres to canvas
- [x] Make the celestial bodies orbit each other
- [ ] Make the solar system a model of our solar system
- [ ] Create a menu or UI to allow user to edit solar system (move or add objects)
- [x] Make a camera that allows user to move around and zoom in/out
- [x] Make a page that explains the math used
- [x] Make it 3D
- [ ] Allow switching simulation between 2D and 3D
